# Efficient Frontier Example

A straight-forward example of calculating an
efficient frontier using modern portfolio theory

## Purpose

The purpose of this file is to provide an example
of how to use Python for quantitative finance
applications. Feel free to use the code as a
template or starting-point for other projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, just 'clone' 
this repository or make edits and share them.

## Process

First, obtain data by scarping stock prices 
for members of the S&P 500 online.

Then, calculate mean-variance data along
with covariance matrices and find optimal
weights for each stock in two portfolios:
  1) Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio (Max Alpha)
  2) Minimum Volatility Portfolio (Min Risk)

Finally, compute the Efficient Frontier
on a scatter-plot using Plotly.
