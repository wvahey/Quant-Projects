# Efficient Frontier Project

### Goal

Build a simple application of quantitative
finance using Python. The code can 
serve as a template to expand upon to
tackle other similar problems.

### How to get Started

Simply clone this repo! 

Please feel free to send edits/ideas.

### Process

Web-scraped price data off the internet
for members of the S&P 500.

Construct mean/variance data along with
covariance matrices to construct an
efficient frontier and build portfolios.

Use data to return optimal weights for each 
stock to build two specific portfolios:
  1) Max Sharpe Portfolio (Max Alpha)
  2) Min Volatility Portfolio (Min Risk)
  
Construct and chart the efficient frontier
on a scatter-plot using Plotly.

Some of the scripts limit the stocks to
a small subset of the potential 500 in 
the index so the script can run faster.
